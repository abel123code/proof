## 2026-07-10: Cap concurrent renders at 2 (env-tunable), don't run unbounded

**Context:** the render service (`render/`) runs on a single Railway box (24 vCPU / 24 GB). `POST /render` fired `runJob` immediately with no queue or limit — so N simultaneous requests started N heavy renders at once. A render is CPU-bound (Remotion parallelizes frames across all cores) and holds a large transparent ProRes overlay in memory during the ffmpeg composite. Concern raised before the SUTD demo: if a room of students taps "render" in the same window, the box thrashes and renders fail live.

**Decision:** gate renders behind an async semaphore (`render/src/semaphore.ts`), cap = `RENDER_CONCURRENCY` env var, **default 2**. Excess jobs stay in the existing `queued` status until a slot frees, instead of all starting together. Env-tunable so the cap can be dropped to 1 from the Railway dashboard (a ~15s restart) without a code change + Docker rebuild — an emergency knob if it thrashes live.

**The number is measured, not guessed.** Load-tested the live box 2026-07-10 (concurrent 15s renders, `render/tmp/loadtest.ts`):

| Concurrent | Result | Avg time/job |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1/1 ok | 34.4s |
| 2 | 2/2 ok | 27.6s |
| 3 | **2/3 — one failed** | ffmpeg OOM |

- **1 render already saturates the CPU**, so concurrency doesn't multiply throughput — it splits the same cores.
- **2 is faster per-job than 1** (27.6s vs 34.4s) because a job spends seconds idle on network I/O (whisper transcription, Supabase upload) where a second job's compute fills the gap. Better utilization, still under the memory ceiling.
- **3 OOMs the composite.** The failed job died with `ffmpeg exited 1: Failed to inject frame into filter network: Resource temporarily unavailable` (confirmed in Railway logs) — memory exhaustion with three ProRes overlays in flight.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Cap 1** — safe, but wastes the idle-I/O window and is slower per job. Rejected as the default; kept as the emergency fallback via the env var.
- **Cap 3+ / unbounded** — rejected, measured to drop jobs (OOM).
- **Horizontal scale (multiple render replicas / autoscaling)** — the correct answer for real simultaneous scale, but real infra + cost. Overkill for a hackathon demo with dozens of users trickling in. Deferred.
- **A real job queue (e.g. Trigger.dev, which the original stack used)** — heavier; the in-process semaphore is enough for one box. Deferred.

**Consequences:** excess renders wait rather than crash; `queued` status is now meaningful (client already handles it). Server logs the cap at startup. **Caveat:** measured with 15s clips — longer clips hold more memory per job, so a 60s+ workload may need the cap dropped to 1. Retrying failed jobs is NOT implemented (an OOM'd or errored job stays `error`; client re-submits). Job state is still in-memory, so a redeploy mid-render still loses in-flight jobs (separate open issue).
